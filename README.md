# WindFingerings 1.1.2
WindFingerings is an interface for viewing and storing fingerings on wind instruments. It was designed to be microtone-compatible, and offers searching for fingerings and for microtones in other temperaments (rather than as a mere deviation from 12−TET). The current version of WindFingerings contains interfaces for 30+ instruments, including flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, saxophone, trumpet, horn, trombone, euphonium, and tuba.

Sorting for trill and multiphonic fingerings is still messed up to some extent
